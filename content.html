        <h2>Types of Insurance</h2>
        <p>There are several types of insurance, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <h3>Life insurance</h3></li>
            <p>Life insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurance company where the insured person pays premiums regularly, and in return, the insurer agrees to pay out a sum of money to the designated beneficiaries upon the insured person's death. This payout, known as the death benefit, provides financial protection to the beneficiaries, helping them cover expenses, such as funeral costs, outstanding debts, mortgage payments, or living expenses, after the insured's death. Life insurance aims to provide peace of mind and financial security to the insured's loved ones in the event of their passing. There are various types of life insurance policies, including term life insurance, whole life insurance, universal life insurance, and variable life insurance, each offering different features and benefits</p>
            <li> <h3>Health insurance</h3></li>
                <p> Health insurance is a type of coverage that pays for medical and surgical expenses incurred by the insured. It helps individuals manage healthcare costs by covering services such as doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription medications, preventive care, and treatments for illnesses or injuries. Health insurance can be provided by employers, purchased individually, or obtained through government programs like Medicare or Medicaid.
                </p>
            <li><h3>Auto insurance</h3></li>
            <p>Auto insurance provides financial protection against physical damage or bodily injury resulting from traffic collisions and against liability that could arise from incidents involving vehicles. It typically covers damage to the insured vehicle, medical expenses for the driver and passengers, and liability for property damage or injuries caused to others. Auto insurance policies can also include coverage for theft, vandalism, natural disasters, and uninsured/underinsured motorists.

            </p>
            <li><h3>Homeowners insurance</h3></li>
            <p>Homeowners insurance protects homeowners against financial losses resulting from damage to their homes and personal property. It typically covers damages caused by perils such as fire, theft, vandalism, windstorms, and certain natural disasters. Additionally, homeowners insurance provides liability coverage in case someone is injured on the insured property and the homeowner is found liable. It may also include coverage for additional living expenses if the home becomes uninhabitable due to covered events.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Business insurance</h3></li>
            Business insurance, also known as commercial insurance, provides coverage for businesses against financial losses resulting from risks specific to their operations. It includes various types of policies tailored to different business needs, such as property insurance (covering physical assets like buildings and equipment), liability insurance (protecting against claims of negligence or injury), business interruption insurance (compensating for lost income during periods of closure), and professional liability insurance (covering errors or omissions in professional services). Business insurance helps protect businesses from unexpected events and legal liabilities, allowing them to operate with greater peace of mind.
        </ul>
